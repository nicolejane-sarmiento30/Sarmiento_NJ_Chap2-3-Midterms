                        I am Nicole Jane Sarmiento, a 20-year-old 2nd-year BSIT student of Catanduanes State University and residing at Real St. Calatagan Tibang, Virac, Catanduanes. For me, web designing / web development is really interesting! My interest in this field started when I was in Senior High School where we created a prototype for an application and I am also one of the trainee of a private training team under of TESDA and they let us practice and create a simple HTML design. In my first year here in College, we created our own website in CC101 that's why I recalled all of the lessons I have learned before. And now in my second year, I used the techniques and ideas in prototyping here in web designing where I am able to use my critical thinking skills and logics. I can say that I am still progressing by the help of these projects wherein everyday, my knowlegdge is gaining, I discover different ideas, I'm becoming creative (just moderately), and my critical thinking skills are enhanced. Someday I wanted to become a Graphic Designer as well as Web Developer since I really love to create designs and in order to give importance of what I have learned in College.
